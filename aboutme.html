    <p>Hi, my name is Alice Mao. I am a high school student in California, and I am learning to code using various languages, such as HTML and CSS. Some of my interests include science and math, and I am excited to learn more about tech and other related topics!
   
    <h3 style="font-family:Palatino"><ins>Fun Fact</ins></h3>
    <p>I love to travel, and I have traveled in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. I have yet to go to Africa and Antarctica.</p>

    <h3>WHAT I'VE MADE</h3>
    <p>Using Scratch, I made a little side-scroller game, where you control a person trying to reach his office building within the time limit. The problem is, there are cars that rush by, and you have to dodge them.</p>
